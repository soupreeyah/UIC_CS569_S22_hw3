CS 569 - High-Performance Processors and Systems

We have discussed the blocking technique to improve the performance of dense matrix
multiplication in the class. In this assignment, you are asked to implement the original and
blocking codes of dense matrix multiplication, run the following experiments on your
computer, report the results, and compare the performance. Assume the array size is N x N.
